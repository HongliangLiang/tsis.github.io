# Trusted Software and Intelligent System Lab ($ color {red} {TSIS~Lab} $)

TSISLab aims to tap the potential of students, cultivate outstanding talents, and contribute to serving the society.

We think: Software systems are the work of people and should be their friends. They should be as correct, secure, reliable and intelligent as possible. Compared with the upper applications, the above characteristics of the fundamental software of modern computing and communication platforms are particularly important.
